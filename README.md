![Home Screen](./static/homepage.png)

This **authentication project** is a **student project** I **built from scratch** during my Continuing Education course at **Toulouse Institute of Technology**.

Working on this project, I learned to use **JWT tokens**, a **.env file**, **cookies**, and **Nodemailer** on the back-end.
On the front-end, I learned to work with **Embedded JavaScript templating**, and I also used **CSS animations** to add some style to the finished product.
